**# Prata6th_CPlusPlus_Exercises **

Repository for where I dump my C++ programming exercises. These exercises can be found in the book C++ Primer 6th Edition by Stephen Prata. The book covers programming basics for C++11 but the syntax, style and core concepts you will learn from the book are applicable even up to C++17.
